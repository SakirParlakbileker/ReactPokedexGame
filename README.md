# Pokegame

Pokegame is a React-based web application that simulates a Pokémon battle between two teams. Each team is composed of randomly selected Pokémon from the original Pokémon series. The application calculates the total experience points (base_experience) of each team and determines the winner based on their cumulative experience points.

# Technologies Used:
- **React**: Utilized for building the user interface components and managing state.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Employed for logic implementation, array manipulation, and component rendering.
- **HTML/CSS**: Styled the application for a visually appealing user experience.
- **GitHub**: Hosted the project repository for version control and collaboration.

This project demonstrates the usage of React components, defaultProps, array manipulation, and conditional rendering to create an interactive Pokémon battle simulation.
